blinx
=====

A tool to estimate the number of blinking fluorescent molecules in a spatially un-resolvable region.


Check out the [documentation](https://funkelab.github.io/blinx/)


`blinx` is designed to work with any type of stochastically blinking emitters, but was specifically built with the analysis of 
[DNA-PAINT](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2017.024) experiments in mind.


At the base level, `blinx` works on a piece of data called the *intensity trace*, which is an ordered sequence of intensity measurements over time.
