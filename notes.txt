Known Bugs:
    1) Alogrithim is very sensitive to sigma_i, if sigma_i is too large it will 
        underestimate Y because it is not punished for large spreads in intensity
        -- Forward algorithm will break if sigma_i is too small, probability 
            will go to 0 for incorrect zs
            -- FIX: make a probability of 0 ok for the forward algorithm
            
            
To do:
    1) change consistancy test so that all parameters are sampled from a 
        random distribution instead of predefined hard values
        
    - re-write all p_trace given z as vector operations applied to all x values in time series
    - outter loop vmap over all z values
